## Feature ideas
- Fishing
- Fish Rarities

- Shinies
- Animation
- Boss slowly comes from right -> each catch does damage depending on rarity, HP/Speed ups per kill
OR (pvz like) fish shoot at boss
- Healing -> more HP?
- Upgrades
- Bait randomly appears for temp rarer catches -> click to activate
- Scaling difficulty (with cap)?

Feedback for player
- Above boss: [BOSS] BossName
- Rarity under fish
- (Cycle through) dialogue box above fisherman: "These darn seamonsters!", "Can't fish in peace!", "Gotta keep throwin' these fish!", "The bigger the fish, the bigger the damage!", "They just keep comin'!", "Gotta fish fast!", "What is this, the Grand Line?", "Rare fish are tough to catch!"

(Need Skill)
Catching: 
- Skill check to catch
- Boss fight after X catches?
- Crit chance -> higher crit chance with catch combos
Skill Check ideas:
- Sequence of keys to press V
- Fish moves around, click x times to catch
- Random yes/no fish questions
-
